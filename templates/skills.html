<h2>My Skills</h2>
<p>
    I have a solid foundation in web development, with proficiency in core
    front-end technologies like HTML and CSS. My understanding of HTML allows me
    to build well-structured, semantic web pages, ensuring accessibility and SEO
    optimization. Coupled with my expertise in CSS, I can create responsive,
    visually appealing designs that provide seamless user experiences across
    devices.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In addition to front-end development, I have strong skills in Javascript,
    enabling me to add interactivity and dynamic features to websites. My
    knowledge of Javascript is consistently improving, and I can efficiently
    implement complex functionalities, such as form validation, animations, and
    data handling. I’m familiar with various JavaScript libraries and frameworks,
    which help me develop robust applications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As for back-end development, I have experience with Python, which serves as
    the backbone for many of my projects. While my proficiency in Python is still
    growing, I’m constantly expanding my knowledge of the language to tackle more
    complex tasks, such as working with APIs and databases. My work in Python has
    enabled me to develop dynamic web applications and improve the scalability of
    projects.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Overall, my skills reflect a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
    development, with a focus on continuous improvement and keeping up with the
    latest trends and technologies.
